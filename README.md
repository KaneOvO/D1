3+ scenes: 
In addition to the opening loading scene and the final credit scene, 
the game includes a basic start scene, a main menu scene, 
and a scene with multiple lines of text

2+ audio assets: 
The game uses two sound effects and a bgm. The bgm starts playing at the end of the loading scene and continues until it ends before entering the multi-line text scene. Sound effect 1 is used in the transition from the start scene to the main menu scene, and sound effect 2 is used in the transition from the main menu scene to the multi-line text scene.

2+ image assets: 
Three external images are used: the logotype text of the start screen, the background image of the main menu scene, and the gear image used to refer to the settings button in the main menu scene.

2+ geometric shapes: 
Six geometric shapes were created, with two black rectangles located in the loading scene as the background and moved out of the screen when over to the start scene. Four small triangles are located in the main menu screen, in front of the text referring to the options.

1+ logotype:
The logo text in the start screen is introduced as an external image.

1+ multi-line text: 
Located in the multi-line text scene

1+ fading animation: 
Most of the text is animated with fade-in and fade-out, and the transition between the start scene and the main menu scene is also animated with fade-in and fade-out.

1+ object motion animation: 
The two geometric shapes in the loading screen will move up and down out of the scene when clicked, and the main menu scene to the multi-line text scene uses "this.scene.transition" to achieve a right shift. The multi-line text also appears as a right shift.
